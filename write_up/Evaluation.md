# Evaluation
I will evaluate my project in conjunction with the end user that I had talked to in the analysis phase of the project. I will be asking him to evaluate how well he thinks I have met each of the high level objectives that I set out in the analysis section, with his suggestions in mind. 

I will then briefly discuss where the solution that I have come up with could be improved in future iterations of the project. 

Here is the list of High Level Requirements that I suggested in the Analysis section

## 1) An RSA implementation that will allow the signing, and verification, of transactions

To attempt to demonstrate that I had met this requirement to my end user, I decided to show him an example of message tampering within the app. I had him register for an account, and create a transaction in which he owed me Â£10


## 2) A way to settle the debts of the group in as few as possible (heuristically speaking) monetary transfers
## 3) A server-side component of the application which can verify transactions, and store / retrieve them from a database
## 4) A client-side component of the application that will have a simple user interface (CLI)
## 5)A database that should be able to store user and transaction information
